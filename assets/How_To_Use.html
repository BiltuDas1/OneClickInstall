        <h2>How to Use OneClickInstall</h2>
        <p>
            Install all your favorite apps in just one click!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Your Apps:</li>
            <p>Browse the list of popular apps by category (browsers, utilities, media, development tools, etc.).
                <br>
                Use the checkbox next to each app to select it.
            </p>
            <li>Build Your Installer: </li>
            <p>Click the “Get Installer” button once you've made your selections.
                <br>
                Our system will generate a small installer file customized just for your chosen apps.
            </p>
            <li>Download the Installer:</li>
            <p>The file (e.g., OneClickInstall-Setup.exe) will start downloading automatically.
                <br>
                If your browser shows a security prompt, click “Keep” or “Allow” — our installer is safe and
                ad-free.
            </p>
            <li>Run and Install:</li>
            <p>Double-click the downloaded installer.
                <br>
                Sit back and relax — it will automatically install all selected apps in the background.
                <br>
                No unnecessary toolbars, no popups, no junk software.
            </p>
            <li>Done:</li>

            <p>Once installation is complete, you'll see a message:
                <br>
                > “All selected apps have been installed successfully.”
                <br>
                You can now start using your new apps immediately.
            </p>
        </ol>
    </div>

        <h3>Extra Tips</h3>
        <p>If an app doesn't install, check your internet connection and re-run the installer.
            <br>
            Some apps may require admin permission to install.
            <br>
            OneClickInstall always downloads apps from their official sources — no bundled software_or_ads.
